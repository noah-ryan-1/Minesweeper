# ðŸ§  Minesweeper
A python based minesweeper game where the player must navigate through a minefield to reach the finish line! The numbers on each surrounding field represent the number of surrounding mines. 

## ðŸ“Œ Features:
- Psuedo-Randomly Generated Grid with mines
- User input validation and error handling
- Recursive algorithim to reveal neighboring safe cells
- Win/Loss Condition Detection
- Modular Codebase (5+ functions)
- Commented and Documented
